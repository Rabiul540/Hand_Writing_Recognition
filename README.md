# ✍️ Handwriting Recognition System using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Handwriting Recognition System** using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques** in Python.  
The system is designed to recognize handwritten text from images by preprocessing image data, training a neural network model, and evaluating its performance on unseen data.

This project is suitable for:
- Students learning **Computer Vision & Deep Learning**
- Beginners in **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
- Portfolio projects for **Data Science / ML Engineer roles**
